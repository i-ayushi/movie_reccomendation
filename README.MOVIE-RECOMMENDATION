# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** — a Python-based project that suggests movies tailored to user interests using content-based filtering.

---

## ✨ Features

- Recommends similar movies based on your input
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** and **cosine similarity**
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code
- Simple interface (terminal/GUI if you have added one)
- Scalable and customizable

---

## 🧠 How It Works

This system uses **content-based filtering**, where movie plots or genres are compared to find similar movies. The core idea is:

> "If you liked *Inception*, you'll probably like *Interstellar* too!"

Steps involved:
1. Load the dataset (CSV file with movies)
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Extract key features using **TF-IDF**
4. Find similarities using **cosine similarity**
5. Recommend top 5 similar movies
